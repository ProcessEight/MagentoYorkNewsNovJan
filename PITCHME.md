Can anybody provide an update on when v2.3 will be available?  Is there any documentation available on what will be included as far as bluefoot / advanced CMS features?  It sounds like the bluefoot module V1 that was previously released will not be compatible with Magento 2.3?  Please confirm.  Thanks!

2.3 is planned around Imagine 2018
[7:19] 
it will include own totally redone Bluefoot
Nick Bartlett [7:21 PM] 
Thanks Piotr!  Can you confirm if the existing bluefoot v1 module will or will not be compatible with 2.3?
piotrekkaminski [7:23 PM] 
to my understanding will not be compatible BUT there should be some migration/import tool for content from v1 (edited)
Nick Bartlett [7:25 PM] 
OK thanks!
